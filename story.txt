Once upon a time, there were three people living in a mountain. They wore black gowns and had never seen other people.

These people were told tales of the outside world from long long ago. Their leader, King Ridik had decided that they must not know
about the outside world. He wanted to keep all the power he could have and by controlling his servants, the black gowns he would refer to
them as, he was able to do exactly just that.
