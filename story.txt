Once upon a time, there were three people living in a mountain. They wore black gowns and had never seen other people.

These people were told tales of the outside world from long long ago. Their leader, King Ridik had decided that they must not know
about the outside world. He wanted to keep all the power he could have and by controlling his servants, the black gowns he would refer to
them as, he was able to do exactly just that.

One day, King Ridik was grew hungry, so he decided to manipulate the servants into building a farm to grow vegetables.  King Ridik said to
the first black gown, "if you do not plough this land, a bear will come and kill you."  He said to the second black gown, "if you do not 
sow these seeds, you will start on fire, and slowly burn to death."  He said to the third black gown, "if you do not water these seeds, you will
lose all sense of sight, and fall off of the mountain."  And so the three black gowns did as they were told.

They have obeyed whatever King Ridik said for long time. However, one day, the king died for no reason.
